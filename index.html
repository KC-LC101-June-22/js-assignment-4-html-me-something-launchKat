                    <n>Homo habilis, also known as the Handy Man(and whose existance as a distinct species is a subject of heated debate),</n>
                     <n>was a wonderful little creature who didn't know what a credit score was. He might be human, but that depends on</n>
                  <n>your definitiion of that is, at least scientifically. I wouldn't let this little guy drive a car, but I think I would let him help me out </n>
               <n>in a garden, even if he would sooner turn my terracotta pots into a handaxe than actually be much help. They didn't make many tools, but what they did</n>
               <n>make has a thousand different uses, most of them are food related though, I will give you that.</n>

               <h2>Many More Made Tools After That Guy </h2>
               <p id="pTwo">
                  <span><n>But what is more fun is the kinds of tools they were able to make.They made all kinds of things, in all kinds of places. Still made of stone and wood, but utlizing our remarkable ability to aim at </n>
                     <n>things in the distance and actually hit them with a reasonable level of accuracy, we have moved on to spears.</n>
                  <n>Although at first a thrusting weapon, and still easily used that way, humans (not homo habilis) have developed the design to allow it to be an accurate throwing </n>
               <n>weapon, probably good for us, since we are not very strong or fast compared to what could eat us or what we could eat. </n>
               </span>
               <span>Along with spears there were arrows, scrapers, knives, musical instruments, and jewelry, because you gotta look good for your crush even in neolithic times.

                  While I do at times wonder what a stone age human would think of modern technology, I don't think it would melt their brains all that much(only a little bit).
                   As long as there's food and a place to sleep I think they would be fine. I think it's most fun to imagine how I well (or not well at all) I would have done alongside them. Even the ones who looked most like modern humans would have more
                  stamina in their pinky than I do in my whole body.

                  <span>
                     <n>
                        But like, go forward a bit to still the stone age but when we also have farming, I think I would do alright. Except I like plumbing and
                        I think that going back in time would not be very fun, I like that we as humans have developed technology that lets me be a lazy little gremlin. I WISH I had the talent it took to make some pretty jewelry out of shells or something.
